# Jeopardy Project
## Overview
For our first wdi18 project, I decided to build out Jeopardy.

When players enter the site, the Jeopardy board will already be built out with set categories and questions of varying value. When the player clicks on a card, a question panel appears with the associated question and possible answers for the user to choose from. If the user selects the right answer, a message appears telling them they got it correct and then they are awarded the point value of the question. If they get it wrong, they are told the answer was incorrect. After the user has selected a question and answered it, that tile is removed from the board. Once all tiles are removed from the board, the game is over.
